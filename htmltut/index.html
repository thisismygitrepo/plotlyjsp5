<!-- HTML is not case sensitive. However, there are conventions for how to write.-->
<!-- Let us start adding HTML elements. Most of those start and end with tags like this:-->
<!--Broser doesn't care about spaces and format of this file, its just for readability.
User prettier to do so.-->
<html lang="en">  <!-- this lang attribute helps search engines-->

<head>

    <!--Below is where the CSS goes. Usually, you would like it to go into a separate file. Beaware that live server doesn't follow those 
    separate HTMLs and JSs and CSSs, so you need manual refresh.-->
    <style>  
    
        img {
            width: 100px;
            border-radius: 50px;

    <!-- Notice that an image element doesn't have  a closing tag. Tthe reason is that it 
    cannot have any childern, so no need for that.-->
    
    <!--Headings-->
    <h1>Twitter</h1>
    <!--A common misconception is to use the 6 headings based on thier size. Actually the size is a style thing
    that is determined by CSS. The choice should be based on hirarchy.-->

    <!--PARAGRAPHS-->
    <p class="username">@ThisIsNotMyID</p>
    <p>This is a <em>Tweet</em>  </p>
    <!-- You would think that emphasis is a style thing and should be handled by CSS not HTML
    Yes, but, being here, it helps search engines understanding what's important about this website.
Lastly, you can always adjust the rule in CSS to control what does emphasizing visually mean. Default behaviour is italic.
Similar thing for <strong> 
    Notice that both em and strong supercede the deprecated i and b for itealic and bold elements-->


    <!--To escape special characters of HTML, use &; e.g. &nbsp; for non brreaking space
        . To see full list: search: HTML entities-->

    <!--Anchors (hyper links)-->
    <a href="about.html"> 
        About me 
        <!--You can add download attribute in the opening tag to change behaviour of clicking on this.
        Alternatively you can add an image instead of this about me text.
    You can create a link to a section. Add id attribute to the header begining tab. Then, in href="#id"
If the id is none, this is a hyperreference to the top of the page and will be placed at the bottom
To link to external websites.
href="https://google.com" target="_blank" ==> use this attribute if you want it to open in a new tab.
Lastly you can also link to emails with href="mailto:programmer@usa.com

Bottomline: link is just the URL or path, a hyperlink is the element object that we click on to takes us there."-->

<!--
    CSS:
    Syntax: Sylector {key value}
    Main types of selectors: Element, Class, ID.
    Element: h1 {color: red;}
    Class: add a class attribute to the element. An element can have multiple classes separates by space.
    ID: a unique (not compulsary) for each element is added as an attribute

    when selectign those:
    bare selection ==> considered an html element
    .class  ==> a class
    #id ==> an ID

    You can also combine selectors with multiple dots or ancestors.

    CSS can be either: inline (as an attribute of an element), an element by itself within a parent, or a seprate file.
    the latter is preffered as it alloows reusability across pages.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href=""> use within head body

    id, class, element is the precendece in case of conflict from lowest to hightest.
    inlines override sheets.
