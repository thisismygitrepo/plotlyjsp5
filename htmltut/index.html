    <!-- You would think that emphasis is a style thing and should be handled by CSS not HTML
    Yes, but, being here, it helps search engines understanding what's important about this website.
Lastly, you can always adjust the rule in CSS to control what does emphasizing visually mean. Default behaviour is italic.
Similar thing for <strong> 
    Notice that both em and strong supercede the deprecated i and b for itealic and bold elements

    <!-- Containers 
    A container is marked by two set of tags and contains other elements. It is a good habit to wrap elements
    inside containers because it makes it easy to manage, and style the whole elements inside with one command in CSS.
    We have two main containers: Divs and Spans.
The fundemental difference between them is that Divs are block containers while spans are inline containers.
In general, all elements are either block or inline types. 

Block types take up the entire width of the screen and cannot sit next to each other. Example: paragraph element.
Inline types can sit next to each other because they only take up as much space as needed. Example: hyperlinks.

    <!-- Divisions (Blocks) -->

        This is my First Division block.

    <!-- Inputs and Forms -->
    <!-- This kind of element enables the user to interact with the page by filling in forms or changing radio buttons and so on.
    Almost invariably, you need JS to work in conjuction with this type of element. -->

        <!-- The reason why some website set the settings to prevent other website from embedding their webpage is to prevent identity theft, 
        such a techniuqe allows impersonation of other websites and facilitates stealing of information if the user thought that he is on the legitimate webpage. 
    If you do not think such a danger is possible, you can make this feature available for your webpage.-->

    <!-- HTML structure tags: PAGE FORMATTING -->
    <!-- To format your html file in a structured fashion, there exist a number of format tags to help with that.
    The are not neccessary as they will not change the content and you can get away without them, however, they are highly recommended
    as they make a readable html file. Additionally, parasbility of your file is increased which allows search engines to udnerstand the
     contents of your webapge, and allow users to jump to sections of the webpage immediately. Many peopel udnerstimate its power.

<!--
    CSS:
    Syntax: Selector {key value; key2: value2;}

    Main types of selectors: Element, Class, ID.
    Element: refers to HTML element by name: e.g `p`, `div` etc, and will apply to all elements of that type.
    Class: add a class attribute to the element. An element can have multiple classes separated by space.
    ID: a unique (not compulsary) for each element is added as an attribute

    when selecting those:
    h1 {color: red;} ==> bare selection ==> considered an html element
    .class {color: red;} ==> a class
    #id {color: red;} ==> an ID

    In general use classes for styling and id's for anchoring (useful in JS)
    You can also combine selectors with multiple dots or ancestors.

    CSS can be either: inline (as an attribute of an element), an element by itself within header,
     or a seprate file.
    the latter is preffered as it alloows reusability across pages.
    <link rel="stylesheet" href=""> use within head body to refer to the separate css file.

    id, class, element is the precendece in case of conflict from highest to lowest.
    inlines override sheets.

<!-- Tips
    If you open developer page of your webbrowser (right click), then new options will be shown for the refresh button.
    Hard reload is what you might beinterested in because sometimes the webbrowser uses a cached version and refuses to reload the new one
    specially when there is large images.
